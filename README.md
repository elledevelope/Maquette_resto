# My First HTML Project 👩‍💻🎉

Welcome to my first HTML project! In this project, I've used HTML and CSS to create a desktop-first design without incorporating any media queries. This README.md file provides an overview of the project structure and how to get started.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the webpage.
- `assets/`: This is a centralized folder for holding various assets used in this web project. It includes subfolders for organizing different types of assets:
    - `css/`: This subfolder contains CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files, which define the presentation and styling of web pages. 
        - `style.css`: The main CSS file for styling the webpage.
    - `fonts/`: This subfolder is designated for font files. 
    - `img/`: This subfolder for storing image files used in the project.
- `mockup/`: Folder containing mockups files.
- `LICENCE.md`: This file holds the Creative Commons Legal Code. It provides details about permissions, restrictions, and other conditions for using my work.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.
